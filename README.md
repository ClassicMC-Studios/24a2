# 24a2

24a2 is an ultra minimalist game engine. It's objective is to let you build a game in a couple of hours. It does this by severely limiting what you can do.

Things 24a2 supports:

- A 24x24 grid of dots
- The ability to set the colour of each dot to one of eight colours
- The ability to read a dot's colour
- Keyboard input (arrow keys only)
- Variable framerate

Things 24a2 doesn't support:

- Everything else
